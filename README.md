# AMES-front-end
This project gave me an insight into web designing and how styling of webiste works. It helped me refresh my knowledge of HTML, and also taught me certain novel spects of front end. 
I took some help from chat-gpt to enhance my learning but made note of every new thing that was used ion the generated code. Making a website from scratch wont be a headache for me now. 
I still coudlnt integrate it on the mobile, the layout went haywire everytime i tried it. The pc version works satisfactorily though.
I also tried to make it interactive but that involoved many aspects of coding that i had 0 information ab0out and i felt it wouldnt be fair to incorporate pieces of code that i personally dont comprehend or cant reproduce.
Finally, i think this project marks my first milestone into web dev and design and i expect to learn a lot from those working with me.
